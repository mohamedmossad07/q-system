## Queueing system for the next models:

- M/M/1: A system with exponential (Markovian) arrival and service times, and a single server.
- M/M/c: Similar to M/M/1, but with c servers.
- M/G/1: A system with exponential arrivals and general (non-exponential) service times, and a single server.
- G/G/1: A more general queueing model where both the arrival and service processes are arbitrary.
